## Notes

If editing any JS files, turn off Prettier extension because the formatting will remove some things and make things not work, a bit annoying

Articles have 3 images, first image will be the cover image or main image while other 2 will be in the body of the article

When making a login, remove password expiration in Server (SQLEXPRESS) Properties > Security so that life is easier
